# GulfOfMexico - Rust Implementation

### 100% spec compliant Rust implementation of [Gulf Of Mexico](https://github.com/TodePond/GulfOfMexico)

This is a fully-featured interpreter for the perfect and best programming language ~~DreamBird~~ Gulf of Mexico.

This is an idea that I've had for a while. I wrote this in Rust because I thought it would be really funny.

This is literally my first time writing Rust code so please don't judge my mess too harshly.

This project was written by a **real human**.

## Usage

Compile the program with:
```bash
cargo build -r
```

Then run it with:
```bash
target/release/gulfofmexico <file.db>
# or
echo "Hello, World?" | target/release/gulfofmexico
```

Replace `<file.db>` with the name of your Gulf Of Mexico source file.

Watch the magic happen!

If you're wondering if this project is actually fully spec-compliant, it actually is. If you're wondering if this is satire, it absolutely is.
